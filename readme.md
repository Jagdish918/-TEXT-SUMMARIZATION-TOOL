## Overview

This project is a Python-based Text Summarization application that leverages Huggingface's Transformers library to generate concise summaries of long text inputs. The app uses pre-trained models like `google-t5/t5-small` or `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` for summarization tasks. The frontend interface is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web app experience for users.
